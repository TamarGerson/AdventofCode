# AdventofCode
repo for all solutions of the advent of code 2023.
I added the specific inputs that I got and the classes. Each class represents a day and a different challenge. I worked only with static methods, no constructors:
one and only one is public and everything else is private. there is no initialization of any object in the main. In challenges with 2 parts, there are 2 public methods- one for each part of the challenge. Until now I have finished all challenges until day 10th first part. I am super happy with the solution of day 5 and day 10- was the first time I wrote a functional DFS based algorithm and not pseudo. I hope to finish all the challenges eventually.

# AdventofCode
repo for all solutions of the advent of code 2023
I added the specific inputs that I got and the classes. Each class represents a day and a different challenge. I worked only with static methods:
one and only one public and everything else is private. there is no initialization of any object in the main. In challenges that has 2 parts there are 2 public methods- one for each part of the challenge

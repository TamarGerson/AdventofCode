# AdventofCode
repo for all solutions of the advent of code 2023.
I added the specific inputs that I got and the classes. Each class represents a day and a different challenge. I worked only with static methods, no constructors:
one and only one is public and everything else is private. there is no initialization of any object in the main. In challenges that have 2 parts, there are 2 public methods- one for each part of the challenge
